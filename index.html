    <p style = "color:white; font-family:Calibri">My name is Anand Mittal and I am currently a Junior at Dartmouth College Studying Economics and Computer Science.</p>

    <p style = "color:white; font-family:Calibri">I was originally born in Canada but currently live in Minnesota. I still have not managed to escape the cold winters. </p>

    <p style = "color:white; font-family:Calibri">Since taking AP Computer Science in high school, I have been fascinated by how algorithms can make previously time consuming tasks much faster.
    I also enjoy being able to operate creatively within the set framework of a programming language, similar to other activities I enjoy like music where musicians have the opportunity to create new songs by reorienting the established language of notes.
    I believe that at DALI, I will have the opportunity to work with individuals from a variety of backgrounds, bolstering creativity by allowing teams with a variety of perspectives to work towards a common goal. Furthermore, having the opportunity to implement the startup ideas of my fellow peers at school would be an amazing experience.
    I did not anticipate computer science being a creative field, but I have realized that developers have lots of freedom in creating something to achieve a set end goal.</p>

    <p style = "color:white; font-family:Calibri">Something interesting about me is that I almost always fall asleep in car rides that are longer than 10 minutes.</p>
